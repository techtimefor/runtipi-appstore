# Bytebot (OpenRouter)

Bytebot is an open-source AI desktop agent that gives AI its own computer to autonomously complete complex tasks across applications, websites, and documents.

---

## üìñ SYNOPSIS

Bytebot provides a complete virtual desktop environment where AI can interact with real applications, browse websites, process documents, and perform multi-step workflows just like a human would. It consists of four integrated components: a virtual Ubuntu desktop, an AI agent, a web UI for task management, and API endpoints for programmatic control.

## ‚ú® MAIN FEATURES

- **Natural Language Task Processing**: Describe tasks in plain English and watch Bytebot complete them using the virtual desktop
- **Multi-Application Workflows**: Use real desktop applications (browsers, editors, email clients) simultaneously
- **File Upload and Processing**: Upload documents and PDFs for AI analysis and processing
- **Live Desktop View**: Real-time view of Bytebot working on tasks
- **Password Manager Integration**: Automatic authentication with 1Password, Bitwarden, etc.
- **API Access**: Programmatic task creation and desktop control via REST endpoints
- **Multiple AI Provider Support**: Works with OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and more

## üåü ADVANTAGES

- **Autonomous Complex Tasks**: Handle end-to-end processes that span multiple applications and websites
- **Persistent Environment**: Install software and configurations persist for future tasks
- **Document Intelligence**: Read and analyze PDFs, contracts, and complex documents
- **No Browser Limitations**: Use real desktop applications instead of web-only interfaces
- **API Integration**: Programmatically create tasks and interact with the desktop
- **Data Privacy**: Everything runs on your own infrastructure with your API keys
